##### Usage instructions

1. Initialize the program by launching *main.bat* (on Windows) or *b.sh* (on Linux/Mac).
2. Enter the X and Y sizes of the board.
3. Now you can set cells alive by inputting one's coordinates. When you're done, input a non-number value.
4. The simulation shall start – the output will display each of the simulation's steps.
5. When the simulation terminates, the program starts over again, but you can input a non-number value to quit.

To this program is attached a *tests.sh* program which tests different initial boards for Game of Life.
